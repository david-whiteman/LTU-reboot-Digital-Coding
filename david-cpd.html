        <p>In today's session we were introduced to git/github, we were shown a quick demo on the advantgaes of using VS Code. We've also had an intro on how to commit changes in files to a repo which we cloned to our desktops.</P>
        
        <h2> 2.1 - 20/10/20 </h2>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Today, we had an introduction to HTML and began coding as a group. This included a history of HTML and insights into the stucture of a page. We then used this information to create a page and start entering some basic features into it, e.g. headings, paragraphs and links.
        </p>

        <h2>2.1 / 2.2 - 22/10/20 </h2>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> In this session we finished the introuctory HTML lessons with more elements such as tables and lists. This led nicely to starting CSS and how we can use it to add style to our content, including text colours. We then created a style file and linked it to our content and pushed to origin </p>

        <p>For homework on this session, I completed an HTML review quiz and scored 33/40.</p>

        <h2>2.2 / 2.3 - 27/10/20 </h2>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> In this session we finished the CSS lesson by learning about cascading priority and its significance when applying multiple CSS rules. We then continued to develop our knowledge of HTML and CSS by looking at divs and how to format them using CSS as well as how HTML5 provided workarounds for common uses of divs.</p>

        <h2>2.3 - 29/10/20 </h2>
