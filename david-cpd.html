       <main> <h2>1.3. - 13/10/2020</h2>
        
        <H3>Reflection</H3>
        <p>In today's session we were introduced to git/github, we were shown a quick demo on the advantgaes of using VS Code. We've also had an intro on how to commit changes in files to a repo which we cloned to our desktops.</P>
        
        <h2> 2.1 - 20/10/20 </h2>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Today, we had an introduction to HTML and began coding as a group. This included a history of HTML and insights into the stucture of a page. We then used this information to create a page and start entering some basic features into it, e.g. headings, paragraphs and links.
        </p>

        <h2>2.1 / 2.2 - 22/10/20 </h2>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> In this session we finished the introuctory HTML lessons with more elements such as tables and lists. This led nicely to starting CSS and how we can use it to add style to our content, including text colours. We then created a style file and linked it to our content and pushed to origin </p>

        <p>For homework on this session, I completed an HTML review quiz and scored 33/40.</p>

        <h2>2.2 / 2.3 - 27/10/20 </h2>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> In this session we finished the CSS lesson by learning about cascading priority and its significance when applying multiple CSS rules. We then continued to develop our knowledge of HTML and CSS by looking at divs and how to format them using CSS as well as how HTML5 provided workarounds for common uses of divs.</p>

        <h2>2.3 / 2.4 - 29/10/20 </h2>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> Tonight we looked at the box model and how it can be used to frame text or influence where on the page it is located and got to apply it to some html of our own. We built on positioning by looking at absolute and relative positioning and tried this in a number of tasks.</p>

        <h2> 2.4 - 03/11/20 </h2>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>In this session we finished css and html by looking the remaining tools to use in positioning and layout including float and frameworks. Frameworks offer pre-made styles or formats that we can use as parts of mock ups or to help us in final pieces of work. We finished with a task to tie together all our learnings where we attempted to copy the google homepage using a number of graphics alongside html and css to mimic the style of the page.</p>

        <p>to finish the module, I took the following tests:
            <ul>
                <li>HTML quiz (2nd attempt) - 35/40</li>
                <li>CSS quiz - 19/25</li>
            </ul>
            .</p>
        <p>I have noted my mistakes and will ensure to look over and retake next week.</p>
  

    <h2> 3.1 - 05/11/20 </h2>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Tonight was our first lesson on javascript where we learnt some background to the language and its history. Next, we learnt how to set up a js document and link it to our html docs. Finally, we began looking at some of the basic elements such as variables and the different ways we can make them run on web pages e.g. in the control log.</p>

    <h2> 3.2 - 10/11/20 </h2>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This lesson we built on our knowledge from last week by exploring functions and control flow. Functions are reusable pieces of code which we can reuse which ultimately help us avoid repeating ourselves. We looked at different ways we can use functions and how they may affect the scope of variables. Finally we looked at control flow and how to use if and else statements to perform a function based on variables.</p>
